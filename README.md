# Projects
The [ARPA-E](https://arpa-e.energy.gov) [DIFFERENTIATE])(https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/programs/differentiate) Program is developing machine-learning-enhanced engineering design tools that are intended to help energy engineers be more productive as they develop technological solutions to our energy and climate challenges.

The program consists of 23 individual projects that are developing (ideally) general purpose ML tools for specific energy-related challenge problems.  These general purpose tools may be grouped into three distinct categories by their intended function--
1.  Conceptual Design/Hypothesis Formulation
2.  Detailed Design/Hypothesis Evaluation
3.  Inverse Design
